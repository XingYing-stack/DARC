These nations, as complex societies, utilize political systems where leaders are often chosen by a decision rule requiring more than half the votes. This rule is explicitly distinguished from another method and is a less strict version of a criterion involving a preferred subset of candidates. This subset criterion, in turn, generalizes a fundamental principle for a single winner with over 50% of first-preference votes. What is that other, distinguished method, which is also listed as compliant with this fundamental principle?", "answer": "plurality voting"}
